This project aims at exploring the idea of color schemes and color compatibility. It consists of several parts:
* Analysis of hue templates model and its implementation
* Analysis of color palette data
* Exploration and implementation of models for evaluating the quality
of a color scheme
* New applications for choosing and using color schemes
  * Recoloring and color swapping
  * Dominant color palette selection
  * Cross-stitch template generation
